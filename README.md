Quantum Dynamics
=======
Created by J.E.Szekely

This set of classes and functions allows computation of quantum dynamics using split operator and alternatively Chebyshev propagation. Other included files contain functions specific to various projects including 2D electron-phonon dynamics and surrogate Hamiltonian calculations. All codes compile using gcc4.8 and require the Boost libraries, BLAS/LAPACK routines, and C++11.
